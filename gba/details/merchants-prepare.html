    <h1>Hundreds Gather in Peaceful Public Demonstration at City Centre</h1>
    <p class="meta">Singapore · Published today</p>

    <p>
      A peaceful public demonstration took place this afternoon in the city centre,
      drawing several hundred participants who gathered to voice concerns about
      rising living costs and community support measures. The event remained calm
      and orderly, with participants holding signs, giving short speeches, and
      engaging in discussions along the designated route.
    </p>

    <p>
      Police officers and safety marshals were present to guide foot traffic and
      ensure that the demonstration proceeded smoothly. Organisers emphasised that
      the gathering was intended to be constructive and respectful, encouraging
      participants to share their views responsibly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Businesses in the surrounding area remained open, though some reported
      slightly heavier footfall as onlookers stopped to observe the event. Public
      transport services continued operating normally, with minor diversions
      implemented around the demonstration zone.

      <strong>Authorities remind the public:</strong> Large gatherings should remain
      peaceful and follow designated routes to ensure safety for both participants
      and bystanders.
    </div>

    <p>
      The demonstration concluded in the late afternoon, with organisers thanking
      attendees for maintaining a calm and respectful atmosphere throughout the
      event.
