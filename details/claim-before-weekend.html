    <h1>Circle Line MRT Breakdown Causes Peak‑Hour Delays; Commuters Face Longer Travel Times</h1>
    <p class="meta">Singapore · Published today</p>

    <p>
      Thousands of commuters on the Circle Line (CCL) experienced significant delays on Thursday evening after a service disruption between Bishan and Buona Vista caused trains to slow down and crowding to build up across multiple stations. The incident occurred during the evening peak period, affecting workers heading home and students returning from school.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Land Transport Authority (LTA) confirmed that the delay was linked to ongoing reliability issues on the CCL, which has recently seen a dip in its mean kilometres between failures (MKBF) — the key metric used to measure train reliability. While most MRT lines recorded improvements in January 2026, the Circle Line was the only one to experience a decline, with its MKBF falling from 2.464 million train‑km to 1.834 million train‑km.
    </p>

    <h2>Crowding and Longer Wait Times</h2>
    <p>
      Commuters reported longer‑than‑usual intervals between trains, with some saying they waited up to 10 minutes at interchange stations such as Serangoon and Bishan. Station staff were deployed to manage passenger flow and direct commuters to alternative routes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The disruption added strain to an already challenging period for the CCL, which is undergoing a three‑month planned service adjustment to facilitate tunnel strengthening works between Mountbatten, Dakota, and Paya Lebar stations. These works require trains to operate on a single platform along the affected stretch, resulting in longer headways and heavier crowding.
    </p>

    <h2>Ongoing Tunnel Strengthening Works Add Pressure</h2>
    <p>
      The breakdown comes as LTA continues major engineering works to reinforce more than 300 tunnel rings along the CCL, addressing a long‑term issue known as “tunnel squatting,” where soft marine clay beneath the tunnel compresses over time. The project, which began in January, has reached nearly 50% completion and is expected to continue until April.
    </p>

    <p>
      During this period, commuters travelling through Paya Lebar, Dakota, and Mountbatten must transfer to shuttle trains running at 10‑minute intervals — a significant increase from the usual 3‑minute frequency. LTA has advised commuters to factor in up to 30 minutes of additional travel time during peak hours.
    </p>

    <h2>LTA: “We Thank Commuters for Their Patience”</h2>
    <p>
      In a statement, LTA acknowledged the inconvenience caused and thanked commuters for their patience as engineers work to complete the strengthening works safely and on schedule. Despite the recent breakdown, all MRT lines — including the Circle Line — continue to meet the national reliability target of at least 1 million train‑km between delays.
    </p>

      <strong>Reminder:</strong> Commuters are encouraged to check real‑time train updates and plan for additional travel time during ongoing engineering works.
