    <h1>Public Holiday in 3 Days: Residents Gear Up for Long Weekend</h1>
    <p class="meta">Singapore · Published today</p>

    <p>
      Singapore residents can look forward to a mid-week break, with a public holiday
      coming up in just three days’ time. Many families are already making plans for
      short staycations, family gatherings, and visits to local attractions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Travel agencies and hotels have reported a spike in last-minute bookings, while
      heartland malls are preparing for heavier footfall as shoppers take advantage of
      sales and promotions timed to the long weekend.
    </p>

    <p>
      Employers are reminding staff to submit any urgent work before the mid-week break,
      as some offices will operate with reduced manpower on the eve of the holiday.
      Public transport operators also expect higher passenger volumes during peak periods.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Key reminder:</strong> Essential services such as healthcare, public
      transport, and emergency response will continue to operate, but residents are
      advised to check operating hours for clinics, banks, and retail outlets in advance.
    </div>

    <p>
      For those staying in, community clubs and public libraries will be running
      special programmes and activities, giving residents more options to relax and
      recharge without leaving the neighbourhood.
